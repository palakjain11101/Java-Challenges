/**
 * An implementation of Dijsktra's Shortest Path Tree (SPT) algorithm.

public class SPT {

	/**
	 * A static method to find a Shortest Path Tree for a non-negative-weighted
	 * and directed graph represented by edges from a single source
	 * node root. Nodes are assumed to be labelled from
	 * 0 to (number of nodes) - 1. The method returns
	 * an array representing a Shortest Path Tree.
	 * 
	 * @param edges a two dimentional array representing the input graph. A cell
	 *              with non-negative value indicate an weighted edge. For
	 *              example edges[0][1] = 2 means that the weight
	 *              of the edge from Node 0 to Node 1 is 2. A
	 *              negative value cell indicate no connection between the
	 *              corresponding nodes. For example edges[0][1]=-1
	 *              means that there is no edge from Node 0 to Node 1.
	 * 
	 * @param root  the input root node.
	 * 
	 * @return an array representing the result Shortest Path Tree. The array
	 *         represent the parent relationship between nodes. For example,
	 *         result = [1, -1, 0, 1] represents the following tree
	 *         (2) -> (0) -> (1) <- (3) where Node 1 is the root (value array
	 *         -1), Node 0 and Node 3 connect to Node 1, and Node 2 connects to
	 *         Node 0.
	 * 
	 * @throws InvalidGraphException  in the case where the input graph
	 *                                (represented by edges) is
	 *                                invalid. In particular, edges
	 *                                is expected to be a two-dimentional array
	 *                                of the same dimention, i.e., having equal
	 *                                number of rows and columns.
	 * 
	 * @throws InvalidSourceException in the case the source node
	 *                                source is invalid for the
	 *                                input graph. This is the case when either
	 *                                (1) source is negative, or
	 *                                (2) greater than or equal to the number of
	 *                                nodes.
	 * 
	 * @throws LoopDetectedException  in the case where the input graph contains
	 *                                loops, that is an edge from a node to
	 *                                itself.
	 *
	 * @throws NoPathException        in the case where there are no paths from
	 *                                the source node to another node in the
	 *                                graph.
